        <h2>Benefits Of Boxing Workouts</h2>

        <h3>Boxing workouts aren’t just useful for amateur and professional boxers – anyone can benefit from this style
            of training! Some of the benefits include:</h3>
        <p>

            Increased speed and agility. Boxers have to have fast reactions and be quick on their feet, so their
            training includes lots of speedwork.
            Improved cardiovascular endurance. Boxing is a high intensity sport, and boxing workouts incorporate a lot
            of cardio and conditioning.
            Total body workout. While it may seem that boxing mostly uses the upper body, the lower body and core are
            heavily involved too, so training like a boxer involves strengthening and conditioning the entire body.

        <p>Successful pressure fighters tend to have a good "chin", as this style involves entering the punching range
            of their opponent before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective.[3] Pressure fighters are
            often either fighters of smaller stature or fighters with shorter reaches, as these fighters more frequently
            have to get inside of their opponent's punching range to land punches, though this is not a rule and there
            are examples of pressure fighters of all sizes and body types.
